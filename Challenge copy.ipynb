        "# Room Occupancy Estimation using Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook aims to analyze and develop machine learning models for **Room Occupancy Estimation** using non-intrusive environmental sensors such as **temperature, light, sound, CO2, and PIR (Passive Infrared)**. The goal is to predict the number of occupants in a room based on sensor data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project is developed as part of the **Machine Learning Challenge (Aprendizagem Computacional), 2025** at **DEI, FCT, University of Coimbra**. The objective of the challenge is to identify a real-world classification problem, apply simple machine learning models, and evaluate their effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset Information\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset used in this project is [**Room Occupancy Estimation**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/864/room+occupancy+estimation), which consists of **10129 instances and 18 features**. The data was collected over four days in a controlled environment, where occupancy varied between **0 and 3 people**.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sensor Types Used:**\n",
        "  - **Temperature**\n",
        "  - **Light**\n",
        "  - **Sound**\n",
        "  - **CO2**\n",
        "  - **Passive Infrared (PIR)**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Experimental Setup:**\n",
        "  - Data was collected in a **6m x 4.6m room**.\n",
        "  - **7 sensor nodes** were deployed, transmitting data every **30 seconds**.\n",
        "  - The PIR, CO2, and sound sensors required manual calibration.\n",
        "  - The ground truth was manually recorded.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Challenge Goals\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goals of this challenge are:\n",
        "1. **Problem Identification:** Understand how environmental sensor data can be used for room occupancy estimation.\n",
        "2. **Data Analysis:** Explore the dataset, clean, and preprocess it.\n",
        "3. **Model Construction:** Implement at least **two simple machine learning models** (e.g., Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression).\n",
        "4. **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.\n",
        "5. **Documentation & Submission:** Record findings, methodologies, and challenges faced.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Load and preprocess the dataset.\n",
        "2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).\n",
        "3. Train and evaluate machine learning models.\n",
        "4. Compare model performance using visualization tools.\n",
